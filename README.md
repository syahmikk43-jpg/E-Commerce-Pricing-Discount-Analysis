# E-Commerce-Pricing-Discount-Analysis
Analyzing product pricing, discounts, and RRP across multiple brands and categories.
## 📘 Project Background & Overview
This project focuses on analysing pricing structures and discount behavior in an e-commerce retail environment. The dataset contains product-level details such as brand, category, gender, color, current price, discount, and recommended retail price (RRP).

While it does not include sales or profit data, it still provides valuable insights into how pricing strategies differ across brands and product categories, and how discounts are applied to various product types and demographics.

## 🎯The analysis aims to uncover:
- How pricing compares to RRP across brands and categories
- Which brands or colors tend to offer higher discounts
- The general price positioning and markdown practices within the dataset

Through Excel (for cleaning and calculation) and Tableau (for visualization), this project demonstrates how limited but structured data can still be transformed into meaningful insights using effective data visualization design.

The final interactive dashboard allows viewers to explore:
- Key KPIs like average discount and price
- Discount trends across brands and gender
- Identify which colour appears most across listings
- Analyze average current price by brand and categories.
- Price vs RRP comparison

This project highlights analytical storytelling — turning simple retail data into visual insights about pricing behavior, brand strategy, and discount variability.
